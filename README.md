# Quantitative Value Strategy
  A Personal Project that centers around finding the 50 best valued stocks through calculating the lowest percentiles of 5 different value metrics:
  * Price-to-Earnings Ratio
  * Price-to-Sales Ratio
  * Price-to-Book Ratio
  * Enterprise Value (EV)/ Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA)
  * EV / Gross Profit

By taking the arithmetic means of these numbers, one is able to identify a robust value (RV) score that informs a strategic trading decision as to what stock is best to invest in and how many shares of said stock they should be buying.
